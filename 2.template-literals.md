#Template Literals
Using double `("")` and single `('')` quotes made easy!  

```javascript
//es5
var text = "Free pizza and doing \"nothing\" for one hour rocks!"

//es6
let text2 = `Free pizza and doing "nothing" for one hour rocks because I'm learning ES6 and don't need to escape "double" quotes anymore!` 
```
Sweet string concatenation:
```javascript
let name = 'Jose';
let job = 'Software Dev';
let company = 'Eikos Partners';

let sentence = name + " works at " + company + " as a " + job;

console.log(sentence);
```
Expressions:
```javascript
let today = new Date();
let text = `The time and date is: ${today.toLocaleString()}`;

console.log(text);

//another example:
const pizzaPrice = 18.99;
const delivery  =  2.99;

const message = `Brian, your pizza will cost $${ (pizzaPrice + delivery).toFixed(2) }`;

console.log(message);
```
Multiline:
```javscript
const multi = 'This is a\nmultiline string.\nNow I need to add another sentence requested by our client.\nNow, one more because I am bored.';

console.log(multi); // Works but messy...ew.

//solution
const multi2 = `This is a
multiline string. 
Now I need to add another sentence requested by our client. 
Now, one more because I am bored.`

console.log(multi2); //cleaner
```
Used in Markup (e.g. Angular2 in-line templates)
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Jose',
  job: 'Software Dev'
};

//cleaner
const Markup = `
  <div>
    <h2>${person.name}</h2>
    <h3>${person.job}</h3>
  </div>
`;

console.log(Markup);
```
