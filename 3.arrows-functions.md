#Arrow Functions 
Not a replacement for `function()` but makes code easier to read (and more familiar to some of us).
```javascript
//ES5
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(add(3,2));

//ES6
const addES6 = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(addES6(4,2));

//ES 6 -- better yet
const addES5Better = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(addES5Better(4,2));

//parameterless
const add10 = () => 5 + 5;
console.log(add10());
```
Why so cool? You can use high-order functions
```javascript
//No arrows
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubleNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) {
  return number * 2;
});

console.log("NO arrows");
console.log(doubleNumbers);

//with arrows
//JS, creating an new object from my original object...FTW
const numbers2 = Object.create(numbers);
const doubleNumbers2 = numbers2.map(number => number * 2);

console.log("WITH arrows");
console.log(doubleNumbers2);
```
Too simple? Let's square only the even numbers
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const squared = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0)
                       .map(number => number * number);

console.log(squared);
```
Syntax allows you to make nice and simple operations (a la C#)
C# guys: 
* `filter()` same as `where()`. 
* `map()` same as `select()`

Lexical scope
```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Jose',
  sayName: function() {
    return this.name;
  }
}

console.log(person.sayName()); // Jose
```
With arrow function, `this` will be lexically scoped. In other words, the scope of the function will be bound based where it was defined. The this will refer to the parent scope...e.g. the window object.
```javascript
const person2 = {
  name: 'Jose',
  sayName: () => {
    return this.name;
  }
}

console.log(person2.sayName()); //undefined
```
JavaScript Scope is a big topic and talk on its own.

**Take away**
Use arrows whenever you need to preserve the lexical value of `this`
